I am sharing my experiences setting up my Deep Learning Workstation. Feel free to contribute.

## Why am I doing this?
I am curious about where Machine Learning and Deep Learning and want to gather experience in applying it. Until now I completed some MOOCs which are listed in my [Class Central profile](https://www.classcentral.com/u/1246063).

## Buying the hardware
I got a good deal on a used [Lenovo ThinkStation P520 (30BE006X**)](https://psref.lenovo.com/Detail/ThinkStation/ThinkStation_P520?M=30BE006XGE) equiped as follows:
  * Xeon W-2133 6C/3.6GHz/8.25MB/140W/DDR4-2666
  * 900W Platinum Power Supply
  * 1x 32GB RDIMM DDR4-2666 ECC
  * 256GB SSD + 1 TB HDD, both SATA
  * 1x NVIDIA Quadro P4000 8GB (CUDA compute capability 6.1)

Applied modifications:
* The preinstalled 1TB HDD was replaced by a 1TB SSD (SATA).
* ToDo: Installation of an additional 512GB SSD (NVMe)
