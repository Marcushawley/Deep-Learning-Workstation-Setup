I am sharing my experiences setting up my Deep Learning Workstation. The main reason I am doing this documentation is to be able to redo all of the installation and configuring if needed. Furthermore, I hope this documentation helps other who are getting started with this topic. Since I am a beginner in this field I might not have used the best way for accomplishing my goal. Feel free to contribute.

## Why am I doing this?
I am curious about where Machine Learning and Deep Learning and want to gather experience in applying it. Until now I completed some MOOCs which are listed in my [Class Central profile](https://www.classcentral.com/u/1246063).

## Buying the hardware
I got a good deal on a used [Lenovo ThinkStation P520 (30BE006X**)](https://psref.lenovo.com/Detail/ThinkStation/ThinkStation_P520?M=30BE006XGE) equiped as follows:
  * Xeon W-2133 6C/3.6GHz/8.25MB/140W/DDR4-2666
  * 900W Platinum Power Supply
  * 1x 32GB RDIMM DDR4-2666 ECC
  * 256GB SSD + 1 TB HDD, both SATA
  * 1x NVIDIA Quadro P4000 8GB (CUDA compute capability 6.1)

Applied modifications:
* The preinstalled 1TB HDD was replaced by a 1TB SSD (SATA).
* ToDo: Installation of an additional 512GB SSD (NVMe)

# Overview
Advantages of using Docker for a Deep Learning Workstation are that you will only need to install the following on your host system. 
* Linux OS
* Docker CE
* NVIDIA Driver

Everything else will be installed in the Docker container. Using containers you can make usage of different versions of CUDA at the same time in different containers. Therefore I believe using them is the best way in developing Deep Learning models.

## [Docker for beginners](./DockerForBeginners.md)
This (DockerForBeginners.md) files provides information on some of my commonly used docker commands, e.g.:
* List running docker containers
* [Retrieve the token of a running dockerized Jupyter notebook instance](./DockerForBeginners.md#retrieving-the-token-of-a-running-dockerized-jupyter-notebook-instance)
